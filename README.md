Special Features:
1. Blinking Score when a player scores a goal.
2. Blinking Winner message when there is a winner.
3. Keys instruction appearing before starting the game.
- it's like "how to play" manual
4. Pause = Spacebar for better pause button
- if pause button is mouse click, then it would be inconvenient when playing 2 player mode.
